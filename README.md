# Improved detection of fraud cases for e-commerce and bank transactions

This project aims to create accurate and strong fraud detection models that handle the unique challenges of both types of transaction data. It also includes using geolocation analysis and transaction pattern recognition to improve detection. Good fraud detection greatly improves transaction security. By using advanced machine learning models and detailed data analysis, Adey Innovations Inc. can spot fraudulent activities more accurately. This helps prevent financial losses and builds trust with customers and financial institutions

```
cd Improved-detection-of-fraud-cases-for-e-commerce-and-bank-transactions-week-8-9
```
### 3. Create python enviroment

```
python3 -m venv .venv
```
### 4. Activate enviroment
```
source .venv/bin/activate
```
### 5. installing dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 6. Create data directory
```
mkdir data
```
### 7.  Running the Notebook (Recommended for Interactive Analysis)

If you have Jupyter Notebook installed:

1. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:** From the directory containing `EDA.ipynb`, launch Jupyter Notebook:
    
    ```
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    
    This will open a new tab in your web browser with the Jupyter Notebook interface.
    
2. **Open and Run the Notebook:** In the Jupyter Notebook interface, navigate to `EDA.ipynb` and click on it to open. You can then run the cells sequentially by clicking the "Run" button or by pressing `Shift + Enter` on each cell.
